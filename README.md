# Content inventory and rolling audits – Services Week 2024
Resources from the content inventory and rolling audits session at Services Week 2024, delivered by Dan Howarth, lead content designer at Department for Business and Trade (DBT). Includes slides, links and contact details.

## About the session

A behind-the-scenes look at how DBT is managing their content estate, with a new inventory. Whether you want to measure content performance, retire old and unused content, or use generative AI to remix and serve content for a specific ask, you need to know the quantity, quality and structure of the content you're working with.

DBT has 12,000+ content items across various public-facing channels, including GOV.UK, Great.gov.uk and services. They're pulling them together into a content inventory, so they have a single-source-of-truth for information about their content, from which they can do rolling content audits as-needed.

## Recording

There's a [recording of the session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/vIciC0YoFBA).
